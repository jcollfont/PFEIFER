abstract = {The underlying pathophysiology of ischemia is poorly understood, resulting in unreliable clinical diagnosis of this disease. This limited knowledge of underlying mechanisms suggested a data driven approach, which seeks to identify patterns in the ECG data that can be linked statistically to underlying behavior and conditions of ischemic tissue. Previous studies have suggested that an approach known as Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) can identify trajectories, or manifolds, that are sensitive to different spatiotemporal consequences of ischemic stress, and thus serve as potential clinically relevant biomarkers. We applied the LE approach to measured transmural potentials in several canine preparations, recorded during control and ischemic conditions, and discovered regions on an approximated QRS-derived manifold that were sensitive to ischemia. By identifying a vector pointing to ischemia-associated changes to the manifold and measuring the shift in trajectories along that vector during ischemia, which we denote as Mshift, it was possible to also pull that vector back into signal space and determine which electrodes were responsible for driving the observed changes in the manifold. We refer to the signal space change as the manifold differential (Mdiff). Both the Mdiff and Mshift metrics show a similar degree of sensitivity to ischemic changes as standard metrics applied during the ST segment in detecting ischemic regions. The new metrics also were able to distinguish between sub-types of ischemia. Thus our results indicate that it may be possible to use the Mshift and Mdiff metrics along with ST derived metrics to determine whether tissue within the myocardium is ischemic or not.},

abstract = {Many aspects of ischemia-induced changes in the electrocardiogram lack solid biophysical underpinnings although variations in ST segments form the predominant basis for diagnostic and monitoring of patients. This incomplete knowledge certainly plays a role in the poor performance of some forms of electrocardiogram-based detection and characterization of ischemia, especially when it is limited to the subendocardium. The focus of our recent studies has been to develop a comprehensive mechanistic model of the electrocardiographic effects of ischemia. The computational component of this model is based on highly realistic heart geometry with anisotropic fiber structure and allows us to assign ischemic action potentials to contiguous regions that can span a prescribed thickness of the ventricles. A separate, high-resolution model of myocardial tissue provides us with a means of setting electrical characteristics of the heart, including the status of gap junctional coupling between cells. The experimental counterpart of this model consists of dog hearts, either in situ or isolated and perfused with blood, in which we control coronary blood flow by means of a cannula and blood pump. By reducing blood flow through the cannula for various durations, we can replicate any phase of ischemia from hyper acute to early infarction. Based on the results of these models, there is emerging a mechanism of the electrocardiographic response to ischemia that depends strongly on the anisotropic conductivity of the myocardium. Ischemic injury currents flow across the boundary between healthy and ischemic tissue, but it is their interaction with local fiber orientation and the associated conductivity that generates secondary currents that determine epicardial ST-segment potentials. Results from experiments support qualitatively the findings of the simulations and underscore the role of myocardial anisotropy in electrocardiography. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Introduction We hypothesize that electrocardiographic measurements from the intramyocardial space contain more sensitive markers of ischemia than those detectable on the epicardium. The goal of this study was to evaluate different electrical markers for their potential to detect the earliest phases of acute myocardial ischemia. Methods We conducted acute ischemia studies in open chest animal, by creating finely controlled demand or supply ischemic episodes and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. Results Under the conditions of mild perfusion deficit, acute ischemia induced changes in the T wave that were larger and could be detected earlier on the epicardial surface than ST-segment changes. Conclusions Our findings indicate that in the setting of very acute ischemia, epicardial T waves have higher sensitivity to mild degrees of acute ischemia than epicardial ST potentials. These results suggest that changes in the T wave shape may augment shifts in ST segments to improve ECG based localization of ischemia.},

abstract = {Introduction Myocardial ischemia is a pathological condition initiated by supply and demand imbalance of the blood to the heart. Previous studies suggest that ischemia originates in the subendocardium, i.e., that nontransmural ischemia is limited to the subendocardium. By contrast, we hypothesized that acute myocardial ischemia is not limited to the subendocardium and sought to document its spatial distribution in an animal preparation. The goal of these experiments was to investigate the spatial organization of ischemia and its relationship to the resulting shifts in ST segment potentials during short episodes of acute ischemia. Methods We conducted acute ischemia studies in open-chest canines (N = 19) and swines (N = 10), which entailed creating carefully controlled ischemia using demand, supply or complete occlusion ischemia protocols and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. Elevation of the potentials at 40{\%} of the ST segment between the J-point and the peak of the T-wave (ST40{\%}) provided the metric for local ischemia. The threshold for ischemic ST segment elevations was defined as two standard deviations away from the baseline values. Results The relative frequency of occurrence of acute ischemia was higher in the subendocardium (78{\%} for canines and 94{\%} for swines) and the mid-wall (87{\%} for canines and 97{\%} for swines) in comparison with the subepicardium (30{\%} for canines and 22{\%} for swines). In addition, acute ischemia was seen arising throughout the myocardium (distributed pattern) in 87{\%} of the canine and 94{\%} of the swine episodes. Alternately, acute ischemia was seen originating only in the subendocardium (subendocardial pattern) in 13{\%} of the canine episodes and 6{\%} of the swine episodes (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the spatial distribution of acute ischemia is a complex phenomenon arising throughout the myocardial wall and is not limited to the subendocardium.},
