function [globFid, indivFids, variance] = findFid(windows,kernels)
% inputs:
%   - windows:  a nLeads x length(window) - array with all the windows of a beat
%   - kernels: a nLeads x length(kernel) - array with all the kernels of one fiducial
%
% outputs:
%   - gobalFid: idx of global fids, determined by taking mode from indivFids 
%   - indivFids: indeces of individual fids,    indivFids=lag(index))+1 (= index!)   this way   windows(indivFids:indivFids+length(kernel)-1) matches kernel best;
%     this means, indivFids still needs to be shiftet to the point in kernel, where the actuall fid is.
